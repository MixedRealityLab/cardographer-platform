## The University of Nottingham Accessibility Statement

### Using this website

This website is run by University of Nottingham. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

* zoom in up to 250% without text spilling off the page
* navigate the website using just a keyboard
* listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of NVDA, VoiceOver and TalkBack).

### The accessibility of this website

Wherever possible, best practices have been followed – but we know some parts of this website aren’t fully accessible. For example, as much of the text is contained within images, it’s not possible for users to modify colour, contrast, font or spacing of that text.

### Reporting accessibility problems with this website

We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. If you find any problems that aren’t listed on this page or think we’re not meeting the requirements of the accessibility regulations, contact
